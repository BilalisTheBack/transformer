# Contributing to The Transformer

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

The Transformer is an open-source, privacy-focused developer utility suite. We welcome contributions of all forms.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/BilalisTheBack/transformer/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as many relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with the label `enhancement`.
- Describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
- Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone the project** to your own machine.
3.  **Create a branch** locally with a succinct but descriptive name.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-new-feature
    ```
4.  **Commit changes** to the branch.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add some feature"
    ```
5.  **Push changes** to your fork.
    ```bash
    git push origin my-new-feature
    ```
6.  Open a **Pull Request** in our repository.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Coding Standards

- **React:** Use Functional Components with Hooks.
- **TypeScript:** Avoid `any`. Use interfaces for Props and State.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid inline styles.
- **I18n:** All user-facing text must be internationalized using `react-i18next`.
